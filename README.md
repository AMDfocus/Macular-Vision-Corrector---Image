🛠️ Key Features
Interactive Calibration Grid
Users click, drag, or tap grid control points to indicate perceived distortions in their vision.

Real-Time Image Warping
Selected images dynamically warp to counteract distortions, helping to restore clarity.

Adjustable Warp Strength
Refine correction intensity to suit personal comfort and visibility.

Save & Load Profiles
Export and re-import custom distortion maps for consistent future use.

Distortion Metrics
Review statistical data—like average and maximum displacement—for insight into visual irregularities.

🎯 How It Works
Calibrate
Interact with the grid to record perceived distortion at specific points.

Preview
Apply the resulting warp-map to sample images in real time.

Adjust
Fine-tune warp intensity or recalibrate until the warped image appears most comfortable.

Save & Reuse
Export your custom warp-map for later sessions or comparative testing.

🧱 Built With
HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
